# Login Redirect Loop Fix Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to fix the authentication integration between G2Own.com and the Invision Community site, specifically addressing the issue where users are being redirected back to G2Own before completing the login process.

## Problem Description

When a user clicks "Login" on G2Own:
1. They are redirected to the community login page
2. The community site detects an existing session cookie
3. The user is automatically redirected back with `?login=success` parameter
4. G2Own sees the parameter but has no user data, resulting in an inconsistent state

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented a multi-layered approach to prevent redirect loops and ensure users are only redirected back after a genuine successful login:

### 1. Redirect Lock System

Added a new `redirect-lock.js` script that:
- Monitors for premature redirects
- Blocks repeated redirects within a short time window
- Monkey-patches login handlers to prevent redirect loops
- Forces a session check when returning with `login=success`

### 2. Pre-Redirect Session Check

Enhanced `session-bridge.js` to:
- Check if the user is already authenticated on the community site before redirecting
- Import an existing session directly instead of redirecting if already logged in
- Add rate limiting and additional safety checks

### 3. Enhanced Session Verification

Created an enhanced `enhanced-session-check.php` that:
- Provides more robust session checking
- Supports force-checking sessions using both cookies and session data
- Includes improved error handling and debugging

### 4. No Auto-Redirect Parameter

Updated all login redirects to include a `no_auto_redirect=1` parameter that:
- Prevents automatic redirects back from the community login page
- Ensures users can see the login form and enter credentials
- Guarantees redirects only happen after actual authentication

### 5. Post-Login Session Verification

Enhanced the `login-redirect-handler.js` to:
- Verify a valid session exists when returning with `login=success`
- Force session checks to ensure user data is properly loaded
- Clean up URL parameters securely

## Files Modified

1. **New Files:**
   - `assets/js/redirect-lock.js` - Core anti-redirect loop protection
   - `community/enhanced-session-check.php` - Improved session validation
   - `auth-integration-test-new.html` - Testing tool for authentication flow

2. **Modified Files:**
   - `assets/js/session-bridge.js` - Enhanced session checks and redirect protection
   - `assets/js/login-redirect-handler.js` - Improved login success handling
   - `assets/js/enhanced-oauth-integration.js` - Better OAuth flow validation
   - `assets/js/top-nav-auth.js` - Updated login handlers
   - `assets/js/left-sidebar-controller.js` - Updated login handlers
   - `index.html` - Added redirect-lock.js script reference

## Testing Instructions

1. Clear your browser cookies and session storage to start fresh
2. Open G2Own homepage (/)
3. Click "Login" button
4. You should be redirected to the community login page and be able to enter credentials
5. After successful login, you should be redirected back to G2Own with proper authentication

For detailed testing:
1. Open `/auth-integration-test-new.html`
2. Use the testing tools to check authentication status, session data, and test different login flows
3. Verify that the authentication status is consistent across different checks

## Technical Implementation Details

The solution uses a combination of:
- Rate limiting to prevent rapid redirects
- Session checks before initiating any redirects
- URL parameter validation for security
- Session storage flags to track login flow state
- Enhanced logging for debugging
- Forced session checks after redirects
- Monkey-patching key methods to prevent redirect loops

This comprehensive approach ensures users experience a smooth login process without redirect loops while maintaining security and proper session management.
