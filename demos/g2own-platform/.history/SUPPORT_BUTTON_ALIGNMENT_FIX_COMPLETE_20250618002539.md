# Support Section Button Alignment Fix - Complete

## Issue Description
The "CONTACT TEAM" button in the support section was misaligned, appearing higher than the other buttons ("GET SUPPORT" and "BROWSE FAQ") in the same section.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Inconsistent Card Heights**: The support cards didn't have consistent minimum heights
2. **Conflicting CSS**: Multiple CSS files (`support-section.css` and `category-card-buttons.css`) were applying different styles to the same buttons
3. **Layout Structure**: The card content wasn't using flexbox to properly distribute space and align buttons at the bottom
4. **Margin Conflicts**: Different margin-top values were being applied from different CSS files

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Flexbox Layout for Support Cards
- **Modified**: `.support-card-content` to use `display: flex; flex-direction: column`
- **Added**: `min-height: 280px` for consistent content area
- **Result**: Cards now have uniform height and structure

### 2. Button Positioning System
- **Modified**: `.support-card-features` with `margin-bottom: auto` to push buttons to bottom
- **Added**: Consistent `margin-top: 20px !important` for all support buttons
- **Result**: All buttons now align at the same baseline

### 3. CSS Specificity Override
- **Added**: High-specificity rules to override conflicting styles from other CSS files
- **Fixed**: Width, display, and position properties to ensure consistency
- **Result**: Support section styles take precedence over generic button styles

### 4. Card Structure Enhancement
- **Added**: `min-height: 400px` for support cards
- **Implemented**: Flexbox alignment for card structure
- **Result**: All cards maintain consistent height regardless of content length

## Technical Changes Made

### File: `assets/css/support-section.css`

#### Card Content Layout

.support-card-content {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;

}
```

#### Features Area

.support-card-features {
    margin-bottom: auto; /* Pushes button to bottom */
    flex-grow: 1;
    align-content: flex-start;
}
```

#### Button Alignment
```css
.support-card-btn {
    margin-top: 20px !important;
    align-self: center;
    width: auto !important;
    display: inline-block !important;
}
```

#### Grid Structure
```css
.support-grid .support-card {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
